# Sparse Low Rank Autoencoder
 Clutter Removal in Through the Wall Radar Imaging using Sparse Autoencoder with Low Rank Projection

## Description
Through-the-wall radar imaging is a sensing technology that can be employed by first responders to see through opaque barriers during search-and-rescue missions, or it can be deployed by law enforcement and military personnel to maintain situational awareness during tactical operations. However, strong reflections from the front wall and other obstacles pose significant challenges in detecting stationary targets. This paper introduces a learning-based approach to mitigate the effects of the wall and background clutter. A sparse autoencoder with low-rank projection has been developed to reduce wall clutter and enhance the target signal. The weights of the proposed autoencoder are determined by solving an augmented Lagrangian multiplier optimization problem, and the regularization parameters are optimized using Bayesian optimization techniques.
